# Users with Roles

Role management, made *simple (?)*.

## Motivation

I think everyone is familiar with `assert(caller == owner)`. Yet, after a while these assertions can become somewhat
complex, especially when you have a role system for administrators. I always ended up writing assertions in various
projects with the same logic behind it. So, here it is, a package.

I don't know if it is of any use... but feel free to use it or even improve the code by opening a PR.
